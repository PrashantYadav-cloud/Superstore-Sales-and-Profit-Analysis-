# Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)
This project analyzes sales, profit, and discount trends using the Superstore dataset from Kaggle. I developed interactive dashboards in Excel with Pivot Tables and slicers to explore performance across products, categories, segments, and regions, helping uncover key business insights.
